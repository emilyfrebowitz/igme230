         <h3>Synopsis</h3>
         <p>For this project, I considered how to make the form more pleasant for the users to fill out, as well as more smoothly in order to help them save time.  The overwhelming amount of information shoved into a singular sheet of paper on the current registration form is difficult to read and laid out in a disorganized and disheveled manner which can not only make it more time-consuming to fill out, but also be stressful and upsetting to the user who probably would rather be doing something else in the first place.  The DMV gets a bad reputation for taking too much of their customers time, being painstakingly boring and overall a miserable place to be, so in order to make a more useable and pleasant form, the design should be visually satisfying and easier on the eyes.</p>
         <p>Because it was originally designed on paper, there is a lot of information asked of the user that might be irrelevant or unnecessary.  After doing an assessment of what particular sections of the form are not relevant for the common user, I condensed the information into a smooth workflow that is intended to save users time and get them through the form process quickly and efficiently.</p>
