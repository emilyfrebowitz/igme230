         <h2>Washington State EAS</h2>

         <img src="easbig.jpg">
         <h3>Synopsis</h3>
         <p>In the beginning of 2018, a Hawaiian Emergency Alert System caused a wave of panic around the state when a ballistic missile warning was mistakenly issued to the public, and a false alarm was not sent out until nearly 40 minutes later.  This Emergency Alert System (EAS) project reconsiders the user interface and experience for incredibly official and vital programs and information, including the smoothness and ease of workflow as well as the organization of lots of information. This project specifically applies to the state of Washington, but could potentially be used anywhere around the country or globe, and is to be used by government officials in charge of alerting the public in case of an emergency.</p>
         <p>The first thing that was clear to me was that there needed to be a larger clarity between what, exactly, the user is choosing to send out (drill vs. real alert).  To do this, I separated the drills and alerts right away.  By the time I got to laying out the template, I decided that having two types of alerts to find what the user is looking for more quickly, as well as the separate options for  drills and false alarms, was the most clear approach and way of organization.  I also considered how it should not be up to one person to send an alarm (later news reports that the person who sent out the missile threat in Hawaii did truly believe there was a missile...) and added a required validation by a supervisor or higher-up personnel as a second confirmation.</p>
