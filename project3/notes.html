        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>The biggest challenges I faced creating this portfolio were the hamburger menu and creating a printable page via CSS.  The hamburger menu was a challenge because it involved interpreting pre-written code and changing it to fit the needs of my website.  I encountered several problems in doing this, such as figuring out and learning how the transition effects worked so they could be manipulated to my needs, as well as figuring out logistics such as how large and wide to make the pop-out compared to the mobile version. </p>
        <p>Learning the print media query was simple enough, but designing for a printable page was a new challenge in learning to rethink page layouts to fit CSS rules and guidelines.  It took a few tries to wrap my head around the concept. </p>
        <h2>Framework</h2>
        <p>I didn't use a full framework but instead started from scratch, but for the hamburger menu, the code was designed for mobile only, appearing from the left.  I redesigned the code in order to suit both mobile and desktop, as well as change settings in order for the menu to appear from the right of the screen.</p>
        <p>For the the image scale, I wanted a slight hover effect on my images, but the original code involved a much more intense hover effect as well as typography overlay.  I edited this code to fit my site better, as a typography overlay was not needed and the original effect was too intense for my minimalist theme.</p>
        <h2>Extra</h2>
        <p>I decided to take advantage and learn some transitions in CSS during this project, specifically for hover effects. I played around with the way different eases and length of transitions effected the feel and the experience of using a website. I learned that subtle, elegant transitions are the most effective in creating a smooth site, and even a minimalist themed website can benefit from soft easing transitions throughout the experience.</p>
